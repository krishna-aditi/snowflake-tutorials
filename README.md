## Snowpark For Python Overview
- The Snowpark for Python library provides intuitive API for querying and processing data using DataFrames
- It can be used to build applications that process data in Snowflake without having to first move data out of Snowflake
- The library also enables data application developers to run complex transformations within Snowflake (using User-Defined Functions, User-Defined Table Functions, and Stored Procedures) while taking advantage of the built-in unlimited scalability, performance, governance and security features
